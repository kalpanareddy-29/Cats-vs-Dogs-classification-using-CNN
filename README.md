# Cats-vs-Dogs-classification-using-CNN
Using a CNN, automated pet doors can be designed to recognize whether it's a cat or a dog approaching, allowing 
only authorized pets to enter the house while keeping strays or other animals out. And also In animal shelters or veterinary 
clinics, CNN-based classifiers can be used to quickly identify whether an animal is a cat or a dog. This can help in managing 
records, tracking lost pets, and facilitating the adoption process. One of the major problem was that of image classification, 
which is defined as predicting the class of the image. Cat and Dog image classification is one such example of where the 
images of cat and dog are classified. Deep learning works like the human brain's ability to recognize an object. This paper 
aims to incorporate state-of-art technique for object detection with the goal of achieving high accuracy. we employ 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address the challenge of distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.
